# Project-Specific Development Rules

These rules apply specifically to social networking and user-centric applications.

## Social Media Feature Development

-   Implement proper content moderation capabilities for user-generated content
-   Design features with both online and offline states in mind
-   Build social interactions with optimistic UI updates for better user experience
-   Implement proper pagination and infinite scrolling for content feeds
-   Design notification systems with user preferences and control
-   Create clear user feedback for all social interactions (likes, comments, etc.)
-   Implement proper error states for failed social interactions
-   Design with mobile-first approach for all social features
-   Implement proper image optimization and lazy loading for media-heavy feeds
-   Create consistent interaction patterns across similar features
-   Design with internationalization and localization in mind
-   Implement proper analytics tracking for feature usage and engagement
-   Create comprehensive user onboarding flows for new features

## User Privacy and Data Protection

-   Follow data minimization principles - collect only necessary data
-   Implement proper data retention policies and automated cleanup
-   Create clear privacy settings with granular user control
-   Design features with "Privacy by Default" approach
-   Implement proper data export functionality for user data
-   Create clear consent flows for sensitive permissions (location, contacts, etc.)
-   Implement proper data encryption for sensitive user information
-   Design with GDPR, CCPA, and other privacy regulations in mind
-   Create audit logs for sensitive data access and modifications
-   Implement proper access controls for user data across the application
-   Design clear data sharing controls for social features
-   Create comprehensive privacy documentation for all features
-   Implement regular privacy impact assessments for new features

# tech stack:
For a social media app transitioning from v0/Next.js to a more robust architecture with Supabase and Python, here's a solid tech stack:
Frontend (Keep & Enhance)

Next.js 14+ with App Router - Great choice for SSR, routing, and performance
TypeScript - Essential for larger codebases
Tailwind CSS - Perfect for rapid UI development and consistency
React Query/TanStack Query - For server state management and caching
Zustand or Redux Toolkit - For client-side state management

Backend (Python)

FastAPI - Excellent for APIs, automatic docs, great performance, and plays well with modern frontend frameworks
Pydantic - For data validation and serialization (built into FastAPI)
Celery + Redis - For background tasks (post processing, notifications, etc.)
Python-socketio - For real-time features (chat, live notifications)

Database & Backend Services

Supabase - PostgreSQL database, authentication, real-time subscriptions, storage
Supabase Edge Functions - For serverless functions when needed
Redis - Caching and session storage

Real-time & Communication

Supabase Realtime - For live updates, reactions, comments
WebSockets (via FastAPI) - For chat features
Supabase Auth - Handle user authentication and authorization

File Storage & CDN

Supabase Storage - For images, videos, avatars
Cloudinary or AWS S3 - If you need advanced image/video processing

Deployment

Frontend: Vercel (seamless with Next.js)
Backend: Railway, Render, or AWS/GCP
Database: Supabase (managed PostgreSQL)
