# Only Friends - App Overview

## What is Only Friends?

Only Friends is a private social media app designed for genuine connections with your real friends. Unlike other social networks where you might have hundreds of "friends" you barely know, Only Friends is built for the people who truly matter in your life.

The app connects you with friends through your phone contacts, allowing you to share moments, stories, and have private conversations in a space free from algorithms, ads, and strangers.

## Our Philosophy

Only Friends is built on the belief that social media should bring us closer to the people we care about, not distract us with endless content from strangers. We focus on quality connections over quantity, meaningful interactions over viral content, and privacy over publicity.

We don't use algorithms to decide what you see - you'll always see all posts from your friends in chronological order. We don't sell your data or show you ads. We simply provide a space for real friends to connect.

Welcome to Only Friends - where your social media is actually social again.
