# Only Friends

**The Anti-Social Social Network**

A private photo-sharing app for the people who actually matter. No likes. No comments. No strangers. Just real friends.

## What Makes It Different

**You already know everyone here.** Only Friends uses your phone contacts to connect you with people who have your number *and* you have theirs. No friend requests from strangers. No suggested follows. No algorithms deciding who you see.

**No engagement games.** Instead of likes and comments, you just see who viewed your post. Share because you want to, not because you're chasing numbers.

**Built for once-a-day.** Open the app, see what your friends shared, close it. No infinite scroll. No notification spam. Your time is yours.

**Invite-only.** New users need an invite code from an existing member. Your circle stays intentional.

**Limited connections.** Start with 15 connection slots. Invite friends to unlock more (up to 50). Quality over quantity.

## The Philosophy

Social media is broken. It's designed to make you scroll forever, feel bad about yourself, and show your worst self to strangers.

Only Friends is the opposite. It's for the 15-50 people you'd actually want to see at a party. Share the unfiltered moments. See what your real friends are up to. Then get on with your life.

No ads. No algorithms. No anxiety.
